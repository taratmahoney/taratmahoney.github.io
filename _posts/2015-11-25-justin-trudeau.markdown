  excerpt: "Here's some work I did in the Liberal Party of Canada's National Campaign HQ as a front-end web developer. The Liberal digital team was robust and full of talent, and we put out a lot of product I am extremely proud of. This was truly one of the greatest initiatives I have ever been a part of and I am grateful to the Liberal Party of Canada for giving the opportunity me to help elect Canada's 23rd Prime Minister."

I tried to tell a story with these page types to help visitors understand the policy in a more personal way to convince them Mr. Trudeau and the Liberal Party were the right team to form Canada's next government.

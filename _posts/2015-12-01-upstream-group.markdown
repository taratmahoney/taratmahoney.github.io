A Toronto firm going through a rebrand asked me to build them a simple, one-page site that told their story and offered an engagement opportunity for potential clients. It's live <a href="www.upstreamgroup.ca">here</a>.

This is where visitors land when they enter the site, so I wanted to grab their attention with a catchy tagline, provided by Upstream, and a button to make the call to action explicit. I also tried out this 80% width navigation bar, which I like because it isn't like every other navigation bar out there. I also like that it gives the affect of peeking out from the top of the page and allows the user to experience the site content more fully.

The mobile navigation is a also a little different than what you normally see:

I have also been experimenting with more horizontal or side-by side designs (like this website) in an effort to be more creative with my use of space on webpages.

Here's a full-page screen cap of the site:

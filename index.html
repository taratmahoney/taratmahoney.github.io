    Hey there! I'm Tara. I'm a web designer & developer in Toronto, Ontario. 
  </h1>
  <p> 
   My background is in politics. I’ve worked on online communications for people like the Premier of Ontario and the former Chief Technology Officer of the United States, and to start my own freelancing business building websites and online communications tools for advocacy groups and political candidates. Doing this work made me realize my passion for building tools for people that solve problems, so I’ve started to learn how to do that as a recent graduate of <a href="https://bitmakerlabs.com" target="_blank">Bitmaker Labs</a>' Web Development course.
